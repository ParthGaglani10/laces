Based on my understanding of your platform, here are some important features that seem to be missing:

1. **Search and Filtering System**

     - Shoe sizes
     - Colors
     - Store distance radius
   - Autocomplete suggestions for sneaker names
   - Search history for users

2. **Store Dashboard**
   - While there's a general dashboard, I don't see a dedicated store-side interface for:
     - Inventory management (adding/updating stock)
     - Managing reservations
     - Setting store hours
     - Updating store profile
     - Analytics (most viewed/reserved items)
     - Bulk upload functionality for inventory

3. **Location Services**
   - Real-time distance calculation
   - Map integration showing store locations
   - Store radius search

4. **Authentication & Verification**
   - Store verification system to ensure legitimacy
   - Store staff accounts with different permission levels
   - Store rating and review system
   - User verification for reservations to prevent no-shows

5. **Inventory Management**
   - Real-time stock updates
   - Size availability tracking
   - Low stock alerts
   - Reserved stock management
   - Stock history

6. **Reservation Enhancement**

   - Reservation completion rates
   - User behavior analytics
   - Heat maps for popular locations

9. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - While the site might be responsive, a dedicated mobile app could be beneficial since this is location-based

10. **Social Features**
    - User profiles for sneaker enthusiasts
    - Sneaker community discussions
    - Store following system
    - Share functionality for sneakers/stores
    - Waitlist for popular items

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these features or help implement any specific one? We can prioritize based on what you think would add the most value to your platform immediately.

1. Replace the mock suggestions in `SearchBar` with actual API calls
2. Implement the search functionality in your backend
3. Add store distance calculation based on user's location
4. Create an API endpoint for filtering products
5. Add product inventory tracking per store

check out each and every page of this website and go through whats going on

okay so this website doesnt sell sneakers directly, it is a link between offline stores who dont have a retail presense and customers, what this website will do is when you search for a sneaker, it will show you all the shops that sneaker is available in nearby you pincode, you can reserve them and pick them up

okay so now that you know what my website is about and you've also read the files, what do you think is missing?
